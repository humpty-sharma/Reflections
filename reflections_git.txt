commit :
		its a user given comment telling about the change he made in newer version

git's saving frequency is upto commit ie whenever a commit is done git saves the new version automatically


commits should be done just at right time.commits should not be too big and also not too small. Every commit should have a single logical purpose.
 
git saves all the dat/files/project in a space called repository(repo)

git works like a camera. Whenever you do a commit it takes screenshot of ur repo(that includes all of ur files related to project)
while other models like google doc takes one file at a time

git clone to clone a repo from one system to other...in cloning all the history is loaded while in simply copying history is not loaded

to load a repo in system the command is cd xyz

git log to see history of commits....most recent commits are shown first

git diff as we have seen before...first id will be considered original and second argument will be as newer version

git checkout sampleID is the command to checkout previous versions of code
to reset the code to latest update again just apply git checkout latestSampleID
